		Design Team 3 has been asked to create a system to keep track of safety equipment on ArcelorMittal's buildings. To do this the team needs to build some systems. These systems will enable administrators to both monitor compliance standards on areas they are in charge of, and make sure that safety equipment is being properly checked and documented. Reports will be sent out periodically on the above to said administrators.  On the user end, an Android application  that uses a scanner will be created that will enable users to quickly answer questions on safety equipment standards.  This project proposal is broken into the following parts:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The teams current understanding of the project.
			\item Define the project in such a way that it will be easy to follow for developers that are maintaining the project for years to come.
			\item Demonstrate that the team has internalized the design challenge faced.
		\end{enumerate}

\part{Overview of Customer's Requirements}
\section{ Background Research}
	There is background research that needs to be implemented to characterize primary hardware and software components that are needed for a successful project.
	To help define what this research needs to be on, we need to think of the customer's needs, and ponder a person, or group of people that would know the ultimate needs of a user. Team 3 has picked our sponsor, Jim Lang, to be our primary point of contact for all things about the "super user". Jim clearly defines what ArcelorMittal needs, and how the user will be interacting with our system. To assess our customers needs, we need to assess how much time we are saving the user by creating this new safety equipment system. 
	With customer needs comes design constraints. One design constraint is time. We have been given one semester to work on this system. Another constraint is going to be cost. We have been given a budget of 500\$ to create this system. 
	Criteria for feasibility of design includes the amount of skill asked to complete a design. As undergraduate computer engineers, we are not equipped to create systems that are very mechanical, or that would include advanced computer programming principles. The importance of creating a system that we know we have the skills to do so is very crucial to successful completion of the barcode scanner.

\section{Project Definition}\label{def}
	This team has been assigned an industry sponsored project from ArcelorMittal USA, who need a way to track their industrial safety equipment within their buildings In order to build the specified system Team 6 will need to build three primary systems. The first being an Android application for operators to scan bar codes on safety locations and equipment. A web application to allow administrators to specify questions for specific pieces of safety equipment, and furthermore assign responsibility to workers. Finally a server infrastructure will be created to ensure data is held properly and securely, host the web application, connect to the Android app, and generate reports.

				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{minipage}
		
	\subsection{Function Definition} 
		In order to justify the existence of items in Part~\ref{scope} the team created a number of function definitions. These definitions were then consolidated into the FAST diagram in Figure~\ref{fast1} along with a more detailed description.
		\begin{figure}[h]

			\input{FastDG.tex}
			\caption{\label{fast1} FAST Digram}
		\end{figure}
		The Primary function for the project is \textbf{Ensure Compliance} This is the main goal of the system we have been commissioned to build. From our primary function are derived two secondary functions each having there own tertiary functions:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Verify Standards:\\
			In order to Ensure Compliance with all pertinent safety regulations the system must be able to check the and verify that all the stranded are being upheld in the various locations and across the numerous safety devices.
			\item Keep Records:\\
			In order to ensure that all of the safety laws and regulations are followed we must keep records of all the locations which must have safety equipment present in a building, what safety equipment must be present, and how to verify that it is in working condition.  

			\item Other 
		\end{itemize}
		From the secondary function Keep Records we have derived: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Generate Reports:\\
			In order to keep records and ensure that every location and item is in compliance the system must be able to generate reports on any set of data on which record are kept. 
		\end{itemize}
		From the secondary function Verify Standers we have derived:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Set Requirements:\\
			In order to Verify Standers the system must be able to set complacence requirements for each location and item which is being tracked by the system.
			\item Set Responsibility:\\
			In order to Verify Standers the standers are being upheld a person must be assigned Responsibility for a number of locations and items within the system. Once this Responsibility is set the owner can be held accountably for there set of locations and items. 
			\item Schedule Checklists:\\
			so that Standers are verified  checklists should be generated to show those who are responsible for items which items need to be checked to ensure compliance.
		\end{itemize}
		
	\subsection{Use example}
		Here the team will use the data from the project description provided an example of how the team plans the how the system will be used.

\section{Technical Design}
	
	\subsection{Mobile Application}
	Design team 3 will build a Mobile application for a tablet device which will allow a user to: download a database of safety equipment and locations to the mobile device to allow the user to operate with out access to the intranet, scan bar codes of locations and safety devices to allow the user to answer a seres of pass fail inspection questions, push question responses back to the database over the sponcers intranet.
	\subsubsection{Mobil User Interface \& Experience}
	Desing Team three has comitiond the world renowned user interface and user expereance designer, Trevor Sabo to design a front end for both our moble and web applications.\\
	\\
	Design Team three will create a user interface and expereance(UI/UX) to guide the safety inspector through the proses of an inspection Figure~\ref{fig:login} the user is prompted to enter three payroll number so that the data reverent to that user can be sync to the noble device and so that the inspection results can be logged under the correct employees name.
	If the users device is connected to the intranet will depress the button labeled sync in Figure~\ref{fig:splash} which will retreve the inspection locations and safety device information pertinent to the user.
	Once the inspector reaches a location they will depress the Scan Barcode Location button shown in Figure~\ref{fig:splash}

	\end{figure}
	
	\subsubsection{Bar code Scanning}
	
	\subsubsection{Off-line Mode}
	
	\subsection{Web Application}
		In order to allow the Administrators to add safety equipment and inspection questions to the database, assassin ownership, set email reminder schedules, and generate reports, Design Team 3 must build a simple web application. In order to do so the design team will use a web app framework to build the fetchers required quickly and robustly.
		\\
		Based on the technical requirements and anticipated need Design Team 3 has devised the foling criteria to judge possible choses of web frameworks: 
		\\
		\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Integrates With Sponsor IT}\\
			Design Team 3s sponsor Arcelormittal USA uses a Microsoft windows baced infistrutur for its internal IT. This is significant because  most of the Internet and so most of the web frameworks are built around UNIX like operationg systems such as Linux or free BSD, While manny have been built to work in a windows environment we must deterin if that exists and if so how well.
			
			\item \textbf{Documentation}\\
			One of the most important parts of any software library is the documentation, If a developer is required to dig thou source code to determine how a library works because there is no documentation which shows how to use it the amount of time which will be required will increse exponetoly and will result in code which is more prow to Constantine defects.
				
			\item \textbf{Ease Of use} \\
			The complexity of a framework can be quite large and part of that can be in the langige the framework is writing in. this requires Design Team 3 to determine how difficult stranded tasks such as serving a web parge, and dynamically creating content. By looking at slandered task the overall difficulty of building the full web application will be.	
		\end{itemize}
		\end{minipage}
		\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Learning curve} \\
			
			
			\item \textbf{Stack fullness} \\
			
			\item \textbf{Third party Ecosystem}\\
			
			
		\end{itemize}
		\end{minipage}\\
		\\
		Then we chose from the plethora of existing frameworks seven which are cominly used in web app development to compare agents these requirements. The each criteria is marked on a log scale of ether 1,3, or 9 and displayed in Table~\ref{WebMatrix}.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Ruby on Rails} \\
			Ruby on Rails is a web framework also known as Rails built in the programming language Ruby. 
			\item \textbf{Django} \\
			Django is a Python built framework and is one the most popular web frameworks. Django is well sported out of the box with numerous built in interfaces and a healthy ecosystem of free and open third-party add-ons to add interesting fetchers.
			\item \textbf{Play} \\
			Play is a Java Web framework. This framework as a large appeal for us as we will be writing our Android Application in Java, and there is a huge amount of support for the language which would be helpful
			\item  \textbf{Express}\\
			Express is a Node.js Web application framework.
			\item \textbf{Laravel} \\
			Laravel Is a popular PHP based web framework
			\item \textbf{Revel} \\
			Revel is the go language web framework. As with many things in go there is one right way to do something and this is it.
			\item \textbf{TurboGears}
			Next generation python web framework. Taking cues from frameworks like Django and Rails this framework uses advanced python and other languages to build a web app.

	\subsection{Database}
		In order to see how items in the system are related to each other the team has created a entity relation diagram.

\part{Cost}
The only cost incurred by the design team will be purchasing a Nexus 7 tablet. The tablet will be of the same model and year or similar to the sponsor's devices.  Due to their security measures, we are unable to use one of the sponsor owns devices. To speed up the process of development, a group member has volunteered their Nexus 7 tablet to be used.
\part{Project Management}
\section{Scheduling}
		In order to better adapt to the complex requirements defined in Section~\ref{def}, we have broken the tasks into four iterative cycles. Each cycle is planed to address a number of the design requirements which must be develop in or near parallel do to the highly interconnected nature of the individual subsystems. 
		
		
	\subsection{Preliminary Set Up}\label{cyc1}
		In the first cycle the team pursues actions which move to the understanding of the finer details of the system it has been tasked to build. This cycle includes several instances of contact with the sponsor in order to both better understand the customers needs and build a relationship for ongoing communication. At the end of this cycle the team will deliver a project proposal to the faculty advisor and the project sponsor along with having verified that the most basic functionality of the database, web application, Android application and design mock-ups. 
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item\textbf{Meet with Sponsor:} (The Team)\\
			The team prepares questions and meets in person with the Jim Lang from ArcelorMittal. In order to better understand the needs defined in the project description. In this meeting the project sponsor was asked to describe key features and furthermore, what a successfully project looked like.
			
			\item \textbf{Solidify Understanding of Project:} (The Team)\\
			In this task the Team meets to discuss what was learned in the meeting with the project sponsor previously. In order to layout the framework in which the team can build the requested system.
			
			\item\textbf{Additional Questions for Sponsor:} (The Team)\\
			After exhaustive discussion on the both the high level work flows and technical feasibility of the project the team will compose a set of questions to be electronically mailed to the project sponsor in order to clear up lingering discontinuity in the teams understanding of the system.
			
			\item\textbf{Set up Database:} (Alexandria \& Ian)\\
			In this task two team members will decide on a framework for building the server side infrastructure for the system. This will include choosing and setting up the server operating system, choosing the main programing language to be used for building the sever infrastructure.
			
			\item\textbf{Hello World on Tablet:} (Kyle)\\
			In this task a team member will build a simple hello world program for style of android tablet indicated by the project sponsor. In building a hello world program for the tablet the team member will also choose a library for decoding bar codes using the tablet camera. 
			
			\item\textbf{Draw Mock ups:} (Trevor)\\
			In this task a team member will draw the initial designs for the user experiences that will be had in the various user portals of the system so that the project sponsor can have an idea of what the user interface will be like and can give us insights that will help all aspects of the teams design. 
			
			\item\textbf{Set up Web Page:} (Seth)\\
			In this task a team member will setup an initial front end for the administrator web sight. The team member will decide on a set of predefined web objects that can be used to build web applications which will best allows the team to build an effective web application front end. 
			
			\item\textbf{Ask Clarifying questions for sponsor:} (The Team)\\
			After facing the initial feasibility challenges involved in the building the main subsystem of the project the team will compile the design report and a number of clarifying questions for the sponsor in order to further refine the teams initial design decisions. 
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		
	\subsection{Interconnectivity}\label{connect}
