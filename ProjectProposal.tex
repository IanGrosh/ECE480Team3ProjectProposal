		Design Team 3 as been asked to create a system to keep track of  and ensure complacence for the safety equipment on Arcelormittal's buildings. To do this the team needs to build three septate systems, a collection server scripts to manage a database, generate reports, and send reminder emails. A web based application to allow administrators to add items to a database and perspective tasks. Finlay A Android application to scan bar codes and recode response to assigned question.This project proposal is broken into two parts, first the project is defined in a way that hopefully will do the fowling:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Demonstrate the teams current understanding of the project.
			\item Define the project in such a way that it will be.
			\item Demonstrate that the team has internalized the design challenge faced.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{abstract}

\section{Project Definition}\label{def}
	
	\subsection{Scope}\label{scope}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Mobile Application
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Off line Mode
				\item Bar code Scanning
				\item Bar code based questions
			\end{itemize}
			\item Web Application
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Add locations to the database
				\item Add safety equipment types to the database
				\item Create questions
				\item Associate Bar codes with:
				\subitem Locations
				\subitem Safety equipment
				\item Associate Locations with:
				\subitem Safety Equipment
				\subitem Questions
				\item Associate safety equipment with
				\subitem Locations
				\subitem Questions
				\item Add Questions to reports
				\item Create timetable for reports
				\item Add rcipeants to reports
			\end{itemize}
			\item Sever side Database and middle where
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Host:
				\subitem Web application
				\subitem Database API for mobile app
				\item Generate and send out reports
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Function Definition}
		In order to justify the existence of items in Part~\ref{scope} the team created a number of function definitions. These definitions were then consolidated into the FAST diagram in Figure~\ref{fast1} along with a more detailed disciption.

		The Primary function for the project is \textbf{Ensure Compliance} This is the only goal of the project 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			
			\item Keep Recods
		\end{itemize}
		
	\subsection{Data Relations}
		In order to see something good

	\subsection{Work flow}
		
	
\section{Scheduling}
		In order to better adapt to the complex requirements defined in Section~\ref{def}, we have broken the tasks into four iterative cycles. Each cycle is planed to address a number of the design requirements witch must be develop in or near parallel do to the highly interconnected nature of the individual subsystems. 
		
		
	\subsection{Preliminary Set up}\label{cyc1}
		In the first cycle the team peruses actions witch move to the understanding of the finer details of the system it has been tasked to build.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item\textbf{Meet with Sponsor:}\\
			The team prepares questions and meets in person with the Jim Lang from ArcelorMittal.
			
			\item \textbf{Solidify Understanding of Project:}\\
			In this task the Team meats and decuses the what was learned in the 
			
			\item\textbf{Additional Questions for Sponsor:}\\
			
			\item\textbf{Set up Database:}\\
			
			\item\textbf{Hello World on Tablet:}\\
			
			\item\textbf{Draw Mock ups:}\\
			
			\item\textbf{Set up Web Page:}\\
			
			\item\textbf{Ask Clarifying questions for sponsor:}\\
			
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		
	\subsection{Interconnectivity}\label{connect}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item\textbf{Web speaks to Database:}\\
			The team prepares questions and meets in person with the Jim Lang from ArcelorMittal.
			
			\item \textbf{Mobile speaks to Database:}\\
			In this task the Team meats and decuses the what was learned in the
