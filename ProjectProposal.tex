		Design Team 3 has been asked to create a system to keep track of safety equipment on ArcelorMittal's buildings. To do this the team needs to build some systems. These systems will enable administrators to both monitor compliance standards on areas they are in charge of, and make sure that safety equipment is being properly checked and documented. Reports will be sent out periodically on the above to said administrators.  On the user end, an Android application  that uses a scanner will be created that will enable users to quickly answer questions on safety equipment standards.  This project proposal is broken into the following parts:\todo{This jusmps around I to much}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The teams current understanding of the project.
			\item Define the project in such a way that it will be easy to follow for developers that are maintaining the project for years to come.
			\item Demonstrate that the team has internalized the design challenge faced.
		\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Definition}\label{def}
	This team has been assigned an industry sponsored project from ArcelorMittal USA, who need a way to track their industrial safety equipment within their buildings In order to build the specified system Team 6 will need to build three primary systems. The first being an Android application for operators to scan bar codes on safety locations and equipment. A web application to allow administrators to specify questions for specific pieces of safety equipment, and furthermore assign responsibility to workers. Finally a server infrastructure will be created to ensure data is held properly and securely, host the web application, connect to the Android app, and generate reports. 
	\subsection{Scope}\label{scope}
	In order to guide the teams design project and ensure the project has limits of what the team will build, a project scope has been defined:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Mobile Application
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Off-line Mode
				\item Bar code Scanning
				\item Bar code based questions
			\end{itemize}
			\item Web Application
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Add locations to the database
				\item Add safety equipment types to the database
				\item Create questions
				\item Associate Bar codes with:
				\subitem Locations
				\subitem Safety equipment
				\item Associate Locations with:
				\subitem Safety Equipment
				\subitem Questions
				\item Associate safety equipment with
				\subitem Locations
				\subitem Questions
				\item Add Questions to reports
				\item Create timetable for reports
				\item Add recipient to reports
			\end{itemize}
			\item Sever side Database and middle-ware
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Host:
				\subitem Web application
				\subitem Database API for mobile app
				\item Generate and send out reports
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Function Definition} \todo{I just played word match with the lists he had in the slides, we may need more of these}
		In order to justify the existence of items in Part~\ref{scope} the team created a number of function definitions. These definitions were then consolidated into the FAST diagram in Figure~\ref{fast1} along with a more detailed description.
		\begin{figure}[h]

			\input{FastDG.tex}
			\caption{\label{fast1} FAST Digram}
		\end{figure}
		The Primary function for the project is \textbf{Ensure Compliance} This is the main goal of the system we have been commissioned to build. From our primary function are derived two secondary functions each having there own tertiary functions:\todo{I think the main probum with what i have here is that i dont talk abut how things are mesured}  
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Verify Standards:\\
			In order to Ensure Compliance with all pertinent safety regulations the system must be able to check the and verify that all the stranded are being upheld in the various locations and across the numerous safety devices.
			\item Keep Records:\\
			In order to ensure that all of the safety laws and regulations are fallowed we mus keep records of all the locations witch must have safety equipment present in a building, what safety equipment must be present, and how to verrify that it is in working condition.  

			\item Other \todo{add more things}
		\end{itemize}
		From the secondary function Keep Records we have derived: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Generate Reports:\\
			In order to keep records and ensure that every location and item is in compliance the system must be able to generate reports on any set of data on witch record are kept. 
		\end{itemize}
		From the secondary function Verify Standers we have derived:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Set Requirements:\\
			In order to Verify Standers the system must be able to set complacence requirements for each location and item witch is being tracked by the system.
			\item Set Responsibility:\\
			In order to Verify Standers the standers are being upheld a person must be assigned Responsibility for a number of locations and items within the system. Once this Responsibility is set the owner can be held accountably for there set of locations and items. 
			\item Schedule Checklists:\\
			so that Standers are verified  checklists should be generated to show those who are responsible for items witch items need to be checked to ensure compliance.
		\end{itemize}
		
	\subsection{Use example}
		Here the team will use the data from the project description provided an example of how the team plans the how the system will be used.

	\subsection{Web Application}
		To Build the web aplication the team chose Dajango based on the martrx.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Ruby on Rails} \\
			Ruby on Rails is a web framework named Rails built in the languid Ruby and is comily referd to as Ruby on Rails. 
			\item \textbf{Django} \\
			Django is a python one the most popular web frameworks and is built in python. Django is well sported out of the box with numerous built in interfaces and a healthy ecosystem of free and open third-party add-ons to add interesting fetchers.
			\item \textbf{Play} \\
			Play is a Java Web framework
			\item  \textbf{Express}\\
			Express is a Node.js Web application framework.
			\item \textbf{Laravel} \\
			Laravel Is a popular PHP baced web framework
			\item \textbf{Revel} \\
			Revel is the go languige web framework. As with menny things in go there is one right way to do something and this is it.
			
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Data}
		In order to see how items in the system are related to each other the team has created a entity relation diagram. \todo{Dose this add anything? It was usful for me}

\part{Cost}
The only cost incured by the design team will be purchasing a nexus 7 tablet of the same model year or smiler the sponsors devices due to there security measures we are un able to use one of the sponsor owns devises. untill such time as one can be procured, a group member has volunteered there nexus7 tablet to be used.
\part{Project Management}
\section{Scheduling}
		In order to better adapt to the complex requirements defined in Section~\ref{def}, we have broken the tasks into four iterative cycles. Each cycle is planed to address a number of the design requirements witch must be develop in or near parallel do to the highly interconnected nature of the individual subsystems. 
		
		
	\subsection{Preliminary Set up}\label{cyc1}
		In the first cycle the team pursues actions which move to the understanding of the finer details of the system it has been tasked to build. This cycle includes several instances of contact with the sponsor in order to both better understand the customers needs and build a relationship for ongoing communication. At the end of this cycle the team will deliver a project proposal to the faculty advisor and the project sponsor along with having verified that the most basic functionality of the database, web application, Android application and design mock-ups. 
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item\textbf{Meet with Sponsor:}(The Team)\\
			The team prepares questions and meets in person with the Jim Lang from ArcelorMittal. In order to better understand the needs layed out in the project description. In this meeting the project sponsor was asked to describe key features and  what a successfully project looked like was discussed.
			
			\item \textbf{Solidify Understanding of Project:}(The Team)\\
			In this task the Team meets to discuss what was learned in the meeting with the project sponsor previously. In order to layout the framework in which the team can build the requested system.
			
			\item\textbf{Additional Questions for Sponsor:}(The Team)\\
			After exhaustive discussion on the both the high level work flows and technical feasibility of the project the team will compose a set of questions to be electronically mailed to the project sponsor in order to clear up lingering discontinuity in the teams understanding of the system.
			
			\item\textbf{Set up Database:}(Alexandria \& Ian)\\
			In this task two team members will decide on a framework for building the server side infrastructure for the system. This will include choosing and setting up the server operating system, choosing the main programing language to be used for building the sever infrastructure.
			
			\item\textbf{Hello World on Tablet:}(Kyle)\\
			In this task a team member will build a simple hello world program for style of android tablet indicated by the project sponsor. In building a hello world program for the tablet the team member will also choose a library for decoding bar codes using the tablet camera. 
			
			\item\textbf{Draw Mock ups:}(Trevor)\\
			In this task a team member will draw the initial designs for the user experiences that will be had in the various user portals of the system so that the project sponsor can have an idea of what the user interface will be like and can give us insights that will help all aspects of the teams design. 
			
			\item\textbf{Set up Web Page:}(Seth)\\
			In this task a team member will setup an initial front end for the administrator websight. The team member will decide on a set of predefined web objects that can be used to build web applications witch will best allows the team to build an effective web application front end. 
			
			\item\textbf{Ask Clarifying questions for sponsor:}(The Team)\\
			After facing the initial feasibility challenges involved in the building the main subsystem of the project the team will compile the design report and a number of clarifying questions for the sponsor in order to further refine the teams initial design decisions.
